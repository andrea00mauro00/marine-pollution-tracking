# Marine Pollution Monitoring System

An end-to-end, real-time environmental intelligence platform designed to track, analyze, and forecast marine pollution events. This system ingests satellite imagery and buoy sensor data from multiple sources, processes it using Flink-based streaming pipelines, and provides a responsive dashboard for environmental agencies to act quickly and effectively. Deployed via Docker, it integrates ML prediction models and geospatial visualizations to detect pollution hotspots, forecast their evolution, and generate automated alerts.

## System Overview

The **Marine Pollution Monitoring System** is a real-time, distributed big data platform designed to monitor pollution in oceans, rivers, and coastal areas ‚Äî with a focus on the **Chesapeake Bay**. It integrates heterogeneous data from:

- **IoT buoy sensors** (pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, microplastics, chemical contaminants)
- **Sentinel-2 satellite imagery**
- **Synthetic simulations** for pollution drift and environmental forecasting

Using **Apache Flink** and **Apache Kafka**, the system processes the data in streaming, extracts insights, and triggers alerts. A **Streamlit-based dashboard** allows stakeholders to track events as they happen and access predictive analytics powered by ML models grounded in fluid dynamics and seasonal patterns.

**Key objectives:**

- Unify real-time monitoring across sensor and satellite data
- Detect pollution hotspots and track contaminant evolution
- Forecast drift patterns using predictive models
- Enable environmental agencies to take immediate, data-driven action

## Architecture Diagram

The system follows a **microservice-oriented architecture** structured into multiple layers following the medallion data model (bronze/silver/gold):

### üõ∞Ô∏è Producers
- `buoy_producer/`: emits synthetic buoy sensor data to Kafka (`buoy_data`)
- `satellite_producer/`: downloads Sentinel-2 imagery and sends raw images to Kafka (`satellite_imagery`), stores to MinIO (bronze layer)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Processing Pipelines (Apache Flink)
- `sensor_analyzer/`: cleans and analyzes buoy sensor readings
- `image_standardizer/`: transforms and normalizes satellite imagery
- `pollution_detector/`: fuses image/sensor data to identify hotspots
- `ml_prediction/`: predicts pollution drift using trained models

### üß† Storage
- **MinIO**: object storage, medallion layers for image processing
- **PostgreSQL**: stores pollution metadata, alert history
- **TimescaleDB**: stores time-series sensor measurements

### üëÅÔ∏è Consumers
- `storage_consumer/`: writes structured data into databases and MinIO
- `dashboard_consumer/`: pushes real-time metrics to Redis
- `alert_manager/`: detects high-risk events and triggers custom alerts

### üìä Visualization
- `dashboard/`: Streamlit dashboard for live insights, maps, and alerts
