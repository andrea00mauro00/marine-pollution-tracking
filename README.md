# Marine Pollution Monitoring System

An end-to-end, real-time environmental intelligence platform designed to track, analyze, and forecast marine pollution events. This system ingests satellite imagery and buoy sensor data from multiple sources, processes it using Flink-based streaming pipelines, and provides a responsive dashboard for environmental agencies to act quickly and effectively. Deployed via Docker, it integrates ML prediction models and geospatial visualizations to detect pollution hotspots, forecast their evolution, and generate automated alerts.

## System Overview

The **Marine Pollution Monitoring System** is a real-time, distributed big data platform designed to monitor pollution in oceans, rivers, and coastal areas ‚Äî with a focus on the **Chesapeake Bay**. It integrates heterogeneous data from:

- **IoT buoy sensors** (pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, microplastics, chemical contaminants)
- **Sentinel-2 satellite imagery**
- **Synthetic simulations** for pollution drift and environmental forecasting

Using **Apache Flink** and **Apache Kafka**, the system processes the data in streaming, extracts insights, and triggers alerts. A **Streamlit-based dashboard** allows stakeholders to track events as they happen and access predictive analytics powered by ML models grounded in fluid dynamics and seasonal patterns.

**Key objectives:**

- Unify real-time monitoring across sensor and satellite data
- Detect pollution hotspots and track contaminant evolution
- Forecast drift patterns using predictive models
- Enable environmental agencies to take immediate, data-driven action

## Limitations

While the prototype successfully demonstrates the core features of a real-time marine pollution monitoring system, several technical and architectural limitations remain:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Source Limitations
- All data used in this implementation is **synthetic** (sensor and satellite), not real NOAA/USGS or Copernicus feeds.
- No real-world validation of the alerting and prediction accuracy.

### üìâ Machine Learning Shortcomings
- Static ML models (Random Forests) trained on synthetic datasets.
- No continuous learning, versioning, or performance monitoring pipeline implemented.
- Absence of drift detection and retraining mechanisms.

### üì¶ System Architecture Constraints
- Kafka is deployed in **single-broker** mode without replication or partitioning ‚Äî not suitable for production scale.
- **Fixed spatial grid** for hotspot detection may miss pollution clusters near boundaries or in highly variable density regions.
- TimescaleDB lacks automated retention policies and advanced downsampling strategies.
- Dashboard analytics are limited (e.g., no export, filtering, or user annotation features).

### üß† Observability & Ops
- No real-time system monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK).
- Minimal observability: only structured logging and Redis pub/sub used.

---

## Future Improvements

With additional time and resources, the following upgrades would make the system production-ready and more robust:

### ‚úÖ Data & ML Enhancements

- Move toward **cloud-native storage** with governance tools (e.g., AWS S3 + Lake Formation)

### üìä Dashboard Extensions
- Add data export (CSV, GeoJSON), time filters, user feedback input
- Integrate multi-layer overlays (e.g., temperature, salinity, wind)
- Add download/export functionality for analytics and reports

### üìå Geo & Spatial Improvements
- Use **adaptive spatial clustering** based on pollution density
- Handle **boundary-overlapping events** and mobility of hotspots
